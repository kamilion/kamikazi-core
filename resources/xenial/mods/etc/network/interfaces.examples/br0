# Management bridge
#
# Generally you'd want to select your uplink devices here.
#
# You should not use the 'auto' directive for openvswitch bridges.
# Instead, 'service openvswitch-switch start-bridges' should be executed later in boot.
# See /usr/share/doc/openvswitch-switch/README.debian.gz
# and /usr/share/doc/openvswitch-common/FAQ.gz  for more information.
#
# Quick configurations:

# This will leave the interface unconfigured.
#iface br0 inet manual

# This will retrieve a DHCP address from any connected port on the vswitch.
#iface br0 inet dhcp

# This will set a static IP address
#iface br0 inet static
#    address 10.0.0.1
#    netmask 255.0.0.0
